# Overview

The principles and concepts of development that are valued most for this project are:

* Web Standards
* Readability
* Performance
* Form Validation
* Semantic Markup

## The Challenge

The attached zip contains a series of PSD files and supporting assets that illustrate how the page should look upon completion. Your challenge is to render this design as a fully functional web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your page should render perfectly in all major browsers. You are encouraged to make this as interactive and creative as possible.

## Technical Guidelines

* No CSS libraries/frameworks may be used, however, CSS (pre)processors like Sass are encouraged for compiling your own CSS.
* Any JavaScript frameworks are allowed (We love to see Vanilla solutions too!).
* The page should be responsive for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.
* Dealers section should be built using the provided JSON file.

## Submitting Your Completed Challenge

Send your finished project via a public link to a Google Drive folder (or another similar service) that contains your finalized assets. The finalized project should follow the following specs:

* Excludes the node_modules directory (or other similar package manager directories).
* Should have a distribution folder that can be viewed directly in a browser.
* Should not require a build process to view the site.

Good luck and have fun!
